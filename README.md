An app for decoding ambulance pager signals in New Zealand

YOU MUST PROVIDE YOUR OWN DATA VIA A Software Defined Radio (SDR) for example a RTL2382U based SDR from rtl-sdr.com

This very much a bodge and not meant to be hosted for online public use (local network only)
Another issue if you do not have a log file present for the day chrome will eventually run out of memory trying to refresh the boxes.

Sharing radio transmissions not meant for you is illegal use offline ONLY!
I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LEGAL ISSUES ARRISING FROM YOU USING THIS SOFTWARE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Requirements
- Windows with XAMPP
- RTL2832U Based SDR
- SDR# Tuned to pager network (see radiowiki.org.nz)
- PDW with filters in place for ambulance callsigns and disabled FLEX-A decoding

Log files for PDW must be created in the same folder as index.php
